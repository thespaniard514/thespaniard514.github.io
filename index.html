<p>My name is Nick Collins, I live in Durango, Colorado. I went to at Fort Lewis College and graduated with a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Business Administration. I enjoy learning new technologies: new coding frameworks, microcontrollers and projects I can use them in (mainly arduino), databases, Android apps, pretty much anything that catches my attention. I also enjoy the outdoors. I love to hike, mountain bike, and ski. Anything I can do with my dog is definitely the best. Biking in Durango is challenging and fun. The trails are well weaved into the town which makes it easy to cruise a lunch ride or after work ride whenever. I am a homebrewer, as well. There's nothing like going up a mountain and then downing a beer (thanks UpaDowna for that slogan). I brew around 40+ gallons of beer each year, and am always looking for new recipies and better brewing techniques to improve my product. I hope soon (I have been talking about it for way too long) to integrate some microcontroller action into my beer brewing process.
